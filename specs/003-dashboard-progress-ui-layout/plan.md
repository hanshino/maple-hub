# Implementation Plan: Dashboard Progress UI Layout Adjustment

**Branch**: `003-dashboard-progress-ui-layout` | **Date**: 2025-10-18 | **Spec**: specs/003-dashboard-progress-ui-layout/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-dashboard-progress-ui-layout/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Adjust the dashboard-progress page UI to organize character information and experience in one grid row, with Hexa Matrix progress displayed in a separate full grid row below, using a radial progress chart from recharts library for visualization.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES2020, Next.js 14  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React 18, Material-UI, Recharts, Axios  
**Storage**: Browser local storage for caching  
**Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers  
**Project Type**: Next.js web application  
**Performance Goals**: Page loads within 2 seconds, chart renders within 3 seconds  
**Constraints**: Client-side rendering, responsive grid layout, accessibility compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: Single page UI modification, low data volume, single user session

**Structure Decision**: Next.js app router structure with modifications to existing dashboard-progress page and addition of HexaMatrixProgress component for the radial chart visualization.
