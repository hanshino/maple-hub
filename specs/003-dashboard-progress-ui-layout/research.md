# Research: Dashboard Progress UI Layout Adjustment

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: specs/003-dashboard-progress-ui-layout/spec.md

## Research Findings

### Recharts Radial Progress Chart Implementation

**Decision**: Use Recharts RadialBarChart component for Hexa Matrix progress visualization

**Rationale**:

- Recharts provides a built-in RadialBarChart that can display multiple data points in a circular format
- Suitable for showing progress levels of different Hexa Matrix core types
- Consistent with project's existing Recharts usage for data visualization
- Supports customization for colors, labels, and animations

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Custom SVG radial progress: More complex implementation, higher maintenance cost
- PieChart: Not ideal for progress visualization, better for proportions
- BarChart: Linear visualization doesn't match the "matrix" concept as well

**Implementation Notes**:

- Use `RadialBarChart` from recharts library
- Data structure: Array of objects with core type, level, and progress percentage
- Colors: Use Material-UI theme colors for consistency
- Responsive: Chart should scale with container size

### Material-UI Grid Layout for Responsive Design

**Decision**: Use Material-UI Grid container with xs/md breakpoints for the two-row layout

**Rationale**:

- Maintains consistency with existing project components
- Provides responsive behavior across mobile/tablet/desktop
- Grid system handles spacing and alignment automatically
- Integrates well with existing Material-UI theme

**Alternatives Considered**:

- CSS Grid: More flexible but requires custom CSS, less integrated with Material-UI
- Flexbox: Adequate for simple layouts but Grid better for complex responsive behavior
- Custom responsive utilities: Would duplicate Material-UI functionality

**Implementation Notes**:

- Container: `Grid container spacing={2}`
- First row: `Grid item xs={12}` for character info and experience
- Second row: `Grid item xs={12}` for Hexa Matrix progress
- Responsive adjustments: May need md={6} for larger screens if space allows

### Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Implement lazy loading for Hexa Matrix chart component

**Rationale**:

- Chart rendering can be resource-intensive
- Only load chart when Hexa Matrix data is available
- Maintains performance goals (3-second chart load time)

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Always render chart: Impacts performance for non-level 6 characters
- Conditional rendering without lazy loading: Adequate but lazy loading provides better UX

**Implementation Notes**:

- Use React.lazy() for HexaMatrixProgress component
- Suspense boundary with loading fallback
- Ensure chart data is memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
