# Feature Specification: Dashboard Progress UI Layout Adjustment

**Feature Branch**: `003-dashboard-progress-ui-layout`  
**Created**: 2025-10-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "我想要針對目前的 dashboard-progress 裡面的UI做調整，目前有三個 card 我希望腳色資訊和經驗值可以以 grid 來講佔一個 row，六轉進度要獨立佔一個 row 因此總共會有兩個 row，而六轉進度的資訊我想要用圖表recharts套件呈現，等等我們來討論應該要用什麼圖表比較好"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-18

- Q: Should the Hexa Matrix progress occupy a full grid row or be presented in a half-width layout? → A: Full grid row (maintains current specification with dedicated space)

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Adjust Dashboard Progress Layout (Priority: P1)

As a MapleStory player, I want the dashboard-progress page to display character information and experience value in one grid row, and Hexa Matrix progress in a separate row below, so that the information is better organized and easier to view.

**Why this priority**: This improves the user interface organization and readability of the progress dashboard, making it more intuitive for users to track their progress.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the dashboard-progress page and verifying the grid layout displays with two rows as specified, delivering improved visual organization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user navigates to the dashboard-progress page, **When** the page loads, **Then** character info and experience cards are displayed in a single grid row
2. **Given** user navigates to the dashboard-progress page, **When** the page loads, **Then** Hexa Matrix progress is displayed in a separate grid row below the first row
3. **Given** Hexa Matrix data is available for a level 6 character, **When** viewing the progress section, **Then** the data is visualized using a recharts chart component

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the screen size is small (mobile devices)?
- How does the system handle cases where Hexa Matrix data is not available?
- What if additional cards are added to the dashboard in the future?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display character information and experience value cards in a single grid row
- **FR-002**: System MUST display Hexa Matrix progress in a separate grid row below
- **FR-003**: System MUST use recharts library with radial progress chart to visualize Hexa Matrix progress data
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain responsive design across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle cases where Hexa Matrix data is unavailable gracefully with appropriate fallback display

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Character**: Existing entity representing game character with level, experience, and basic info
- **Hexa Matrix**: Existing entity representing Hexa Matrix progress data for level 6+ characters

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view the reorganized dashboard-progress layout within 2 seconds of page load
- **SC-002**: Layout displays correctly and remains usable on screens smaller than 768px width
- **SC-003**: Hexa Matrix chart renders accurately and loads within 3 seconds when data is available
- **SC-004**: User feedback shows improved satisfaction with dashboard organization (target: 80% positive responses in surveys)
