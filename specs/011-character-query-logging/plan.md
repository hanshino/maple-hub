# Implementation Plan: Character Query Logging

**Branch**: `011-character-query-logging` | **Date**: 2025-10-25 | **Spec**: [link to spec.md](specs/011-character-query-logging/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/011-character-query-logging/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a middleware in Next.js to capture OCIDs from API calls, check against existing Google Sheets data, and store only new OCIDs locally in memory. Provide an API endpoint for manual batch sync to Google Sheets.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES2020, Next.js 14  
**Primary Dependencies**: Google Sheets API, Next.js middleware, Axios  
**Storage**: Local memory (in-memory storage), Google Sheets for persistence  
**Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests  
**Target Platform**: Web application (Next.js)  
**Project Type**: Web application  
**Performance Goals**: API responses under 200ms, minimal overhead on existing API calls  
**Constraints**: Trigger OCID logging on every API call with OCID parameter, no separate scheduling, use middleware  
**Scale/Scope**: Handle up to 1000 concurrent users, simple existence check against Google Sheets

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- [x] User-Centric Design: Feature is backend logging with minimal user impact
- [x] API Integration Excellence: Robust Google Sheets API integration with error handling
- [x] Component Reusability: No new components required, middleware approach
- [x] Comprehensive Testing: Jest unit and integration tests for middleware and sync API
- [ ] Data Visualization: Not applicable for this backend feature
- [x] Performance & Optimization: Minimal overhead on API calls, in-memory storage
- [x] Simplicity & Maintainability: Clean middleware implementation, ES2020 standards
- [x] API Security and Architecture: Secure Google Sheets API key management
- [x] Code Quality Gates: Lint and format checks in development workflow
- [ ] MUI Component Maximization: Not applicable for backend middleware

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure with middleware in app/ directory, new libs for logging and Google Sheets integration, and tests for new functionality.

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_
