# Feature Specification: Character Query Logging

**Feature Branch**: `011-character-query-logging`  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "我想要做一個功能是，每當有人用本服務查詢角色的時候，要把他的名字記錄下來，後續我們可以去維護一個資料表，可能是用 google sheet，定時去爬所有已記錄過的角色的戰力，做個排行榜出來"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-24

- Q: What should be the primary identifier recorded for characters in the query log? → A: OCID (since character names can change, OCID is more stable)
- Q: What is the scope of this implementation? → A: Focus only on uploading OCID to Google Sheet mechanism, defer leaderboard functionality

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Record Character Queries (Priority: P1)

As a user, when I search for a character in the service, the system automatically records the character's OCID by uploading it to Google Sheet.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables data collection for future leaderboard maintenance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by performing a character search and verifying that the character's OCID is uploaded to Google Sheet.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user performs a character search, **When** the search completes successfully, **Then** the character's OCID is uploaded to Google Sheet.
2. **Given** multiple users search for the same character, **When** searches are performed, **Then** each search uploads the character's OCID to Google Sheet without duplication issues.

### User Story 2 - Maintain Leaderboard (Deferred)

As an administrator, I want to maintain a leaderboard that ranks characters by their combat power based on recorded queries. (Deferred for future implementation)

**Why deferred**: Focus on core data collection mechanism first.

**Independent Test**: N/A - deferred.

**Acceptance Scenarios**: N/A - deferred.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a character OCID contains special characters or is very long?
- How does the system handle duplicate OCIDs from different queries?
- What happens if Google Sheet is temporarily unavailable during upload?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST upload the character's OCID to Google Sheet whenever a user performs a character search.
- **FR-002**: System MUST handle character OCIDs with special characters and varying lengths.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Character Query Log**: Represents recorded character searches, with attributes like OCID and timestamp (stored in Google Sheet).

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of successful character searches result in the character's OCID being uploaded to Google Sheet.
