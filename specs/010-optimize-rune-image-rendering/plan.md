# Implementation Plan: Optimize Rune Image Rendering

**Branch**: `010-optimize-rune-image-rendering` | **Date**: 2025-10-21 | **Spec**: specs/010-optimize-rune-image-rendering/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/010-optimize-rune-image-rendering/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Replace Next.js Image component usage with direct Nexon URLs for all image rendering in RuneSystems and EquipmentDialog components, implementing fallback handling and conducting a full application audit to ensure no backend image generation occurs.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES2020  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14, React 18, Material-UI  
**Storage**: Client-side localStorage for caching  
**Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests  
**Target Platform**: Web browser  
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js frontend)  
**Performance Goals**: Reduce backend traffic by 50%, improve page load time by 20%  
**Constraints**: All Nexon API calls must go through Next.js backend routes; no direct external API calls from frontend  
**Scale/Scope**: Single page application with multiple components displaying Nexon images

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- [x] User-Centric Design: Confirm feature prioritizes user experience and accessibility
- [x] API Integration Excellence: Ensure robust external API handling with error management
- [x] Component Reusability: Plan for modular React components with consistent styling
- [x] Comprehensive Testing: Include unit, integration, and accessibility testing
- [ ] Data Visualization: Plan for clear data visualization where applicable (N/A for this feature)
- [x] Performance & Optimization: Include performance optimization measures
- [x] Simplicity & Maintainability: Start simple, apply clean code principles
- [x] API Security and Architecture: Ensure Nexon OpenAPI calls go through Next.js backend routes
- [x] Code Quality Gates: Plan for linting and formatting checks in development workflow

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
