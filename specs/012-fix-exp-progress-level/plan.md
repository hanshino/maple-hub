# Implementation Plan: Adjust Experience Progress Component Considering Level

**Branch**: `012-fix-exp-progress-level` | **Date**: 2025-10-26 | **Spec**: specs/012-fix-exp-progress-level/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/012-fix-exp-progress-level/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Modify ProgressChart.js component to handle level transitions by adding 100\*n to higher level percentages for proper chart visualization, ensuring cross-level growth appears as continuous progression in the line chart.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES2020  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14, React 18, Axios, Material-UI, Recharts  
**Storage**: Client-side localStorage for chart data  
**Testing**: Jest for component testing  
**Target Platform**: Web browser  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend-only)  
**Performance Goals**: Fast chart rendering, smooth user interaction  
**Constraints**: Frontend-only implementation, no backend changes, single component modification  
**Scale/Scope**: Single component enhancement with level-aware calculations

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._
