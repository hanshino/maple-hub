# Implementation Plan: Add Rune Systems to Character Info

**Branch**: `007-add-rune-systems` | **Date**: 2025-10-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-add-rune-systems/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Display Secret, True, and Luxury Authentic rune information in a tabbed card interface with progress bars, icons, levels, and force values. Retrieve data from Nexon's external API with error handling and skeleton placeholders.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES2020  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14, React 18, Axios, Material-UI  
**Storage**: N/A (client-side only)  
**Testing**: Jest  
**Target Platform**: Web browser  
**Project Type**: Web application  
**Performance Goals**: Load rune information within 3 seconds  
**Constraints**: Client-side data handling, API key management  
**Scale/Scope**: Single character view with up to 18 runes (6 per type)

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- [x] User-Centric Design: Feature displays rune information with progress bars and tabbed interface for intuitive navigation
- [x] API Integration Excellence: Robust handling of external Nexon API with error states and graceful degradation
- [x] Component Reusability: Modular React components for rune cards, progress bars, and tabbed interface
- [x] Comprehensive Testing: Unit tests for components, integration tests for API calls, accessibility testing for UI
- [x] Data Visualization: Progress bars and icons provide clear visual representation of rune status
- [x] Performance & Optimization: Efficient API calls, skeleton loading, and optimized rendering for fast display
- [x] Simplicity & Maintainability: Clean component structure following ES2020 standards and consistent styling

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
