# Research & Technical Decisions

**Feature**: Add Rune Systems to Character Info
**Date**: 2025-10-18

## Decisions Made

### Technology Stack

**Decision**: Use JavaScript ES2020, Next.js 14, React 18, Axios for API calls, Material-UI for components
**Rationale**: Aligns with project constitution and existing codebase
**Alternatives Considered**: None - constitution mandates these technologies

### API Integration Pattern

**Decision**: Client-side API calls through Next.js API routes for security
**Rationale**: Constitution requires API key management for production, Next.js routes provide server-side proxy
**Alternatives Considered**: Direct client-side calls (rejected due to security concerns)

### UI Component Structure

**Decision**: Tabbed card interface with switch button, progress bars using Material-UI components
**Rationale**: Follows user-centric design principle, provides intuitive navigation for multiple rune types
**Alternatives Considered**: Accordion layout (rejected for less efficient space usage), single scrollable list (rejected for poor organization)

### Progress Calculation

**Decision**: Implement client-side calculation using provided formulas
**Rationale**: Avoids additional API calls, ensures real-time accuracy
**Alternatives Considered**: Server-side calculation (rejected for unnecessary complexity)

### Error Handling

**Decision**: Graceful degradation with skeleton placeholders and user-friendly error messages
**Rationale**: Meets API integration excellence principle
**Alternatives Considered**: Full page errors (rejected for poor UX)

### Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Skeleton loading, efficient re-rendering, API response caching
**Rationale**: Meets performance goals of <3s load time
**Alternatives Considered**: None - optimizations align with constitution requirements
