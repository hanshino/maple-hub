### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation

- Utilities before components## Phase 5: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- Components before page integration

- Core implementation before error handling**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- Story complete before moving to next priority

- [x] T019 [P] Add TypeScript types for Hexa Matrix data structures (Note: Using JavaScript with JSDoc comments instead)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately

````bash- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories

# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion

Task: "Unit test for resource calculation in __tests__/lib/hexaMatrixUtils.test.js"  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)

Task: "Unit test for API client in __tests__/lib/hexaMatrixApi.test.js"  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)

Task: "Component test for HexaMatrixProgress in __tests__/components/HexaMatrixProgress.test.js"- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete



# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:### User Story Dependencies

Task: "Create HexaMatrixProgress component in components/HexaMatrixProgress.js"

Task: "Create HexaMatrixCoreCard component in components/HexaMatrixCoreCard.js"- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

```- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 error handling



---### Within Each User Story



## Implementation Strategy- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation

- Utilities before components

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)- Components before page integration

- Core implementation before error handling

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup- Story complete before moving to next priority

2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)

3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1### Parallel Opportunities

4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently

5. Deploy/demo if ready- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)

### Incremental Delivery- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)

- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready- Components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel

2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)

3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo---

4. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

### Parallel Team Strategy

```bash

With multiple developers:# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:

Task: "Unit test for resource calculation in __tests__/lib/hexaMatrixUtils.test.js"

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational togetherTask: "Unit test for API client in __tests__/lib/hexaMatrixApi.test.js"

2. Once Foundational is done:Task: "Component test for HexaMatrixProgress in __tests__/components/HexaMatrixProgress.test.js"

   - Developer A: User Story 1

   - Developer B: User Story 2# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:

3. Stories complete and integrate independentlyTask: "Create HexaMatrixProgress component in components/HexaMatrixProgress.js"

Task: "Create HexaMatrixCoreCard component in components/HexaMatrixCoreCard.js"

## Notes---



- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies## Implementation Strategy

- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability

- Each user story should be independently completable and testable### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

- Verify tests fail before implementing

- Commit after each task or logical group1. Complete Phase 1: Setup

- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)

- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
