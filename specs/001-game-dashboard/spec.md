# Feature Specification: Game Content Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-game-dashboard`  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "我主要想做一個遊戲內容儀表板，我現在可以串接遊戲提供的 openapi 可以獲得遊戲腳色的各種資訊，我會做很多串接，例如腳色的練等進度之類的，這只是初期規劃，後續可能還會根據這些內容來做小工具，這樣子的規格夠明確嗎？我還需要提供什麼"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - View Character Information (Priority: P1)

As a player, I want to view my character's basic information on the dashboard so that I can quickly see my current status.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the dashboard, providing immediate value to users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and verifying character data is displayed correctly, delivering value as a basic info viewer.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is logged in with valid credentials, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** they see their character's level and basic stats
2. **Given** user has multiple characters, **When** they select a character, **Then** the dashboard updates to show that character's information

### User Story 2 - Track Leveling Progress (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want to see detailed leveling progress so that I can plan my gameplay and track advancement.

**Why this priority**: Provides deeper insight into character development, enhancing user engagement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing progress indicators and verifying accuracy against API data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user views the dashboard, **When** they look at progress section, **Then** they see current level, experience points, and progress to next level
2. **Given** character is at max level, **When** they view progress, **Then** appropriate message is shown

---

### User Story 3 - Handle API Integration Errors (Priority: P3)

As a player, I want the dashboard to handle API issues gracefully so that I can still access available information.

**Why this priority**: Ensures reliability and user experience even when external services have issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating API failures and verifying user-friendly error messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** API is temporarily unavailable, **When** user accesses dashboard, **Then** they see a clear error message and cached data if available
2. **Given** API returns invalid data, **When** dashboard loads, **Then** it shows a warning and doesn't crash

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-16

- Q: What small tools are planned for later development? → A: Experience dashboard with leveling time statistics
- Q: How should leveling time estimation be calculated? → A: B - 基於歷史數據計算平均每日成長率，預測達到100%所需天數
- Q: How should API timestamp data be handled and displayed? → A: B - 檢查API返回的時間字段格式，如果是Unix timestamp需要轉換，如果為null則顯示當前時間

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the OpenAPI is down or rate-limited?
- How does the system handle characters with no progress data?
- What if user has no characters or invalid API credentials?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST retrieve character information from the game's OpenAPI
- **FR-002**: System MUST display character leveling progress with visual indicators
- **FR-006**: System MUST calculate leveling time estimation based on historical daily growth rate data
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **FR-007**: System MUST properly parse and display API timestamp data, handling Unix timestamps and null values
- **FR-008**: System MUST display character creation date when available from API
- **FR-009**: System MUST show 10-day progress prediction trend line in gray color on progress charts
- **FR-004**: System MUST support multiple characters per user
- **FR-005**: System MUST authenticate users to access their character data via No authentication required for initial version, data handled client-side in browser local storage

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Character**: Represents a game character, key attributes: level (integer), experience points (integer), progress percentage (decimal), name (string), class (string), experience percentage over time (for statistics), creation_date (datetime, optional)

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view character information within 3 seconds after accessing the dashboard
- **SC-002**: Dashboard loads successfully in 95% of user sessions
- **SC-003**: 90% of users report the leveling progress tracking as helpful in surveys
- **SC-004**: System handles API failures without crashes in 99% of error scenarios
