# Research: Game Content Dashboard

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Decision: Next.js 14 for full-stack framework

**Rationale**: Provides both frontend and minimal backend API routes for proxying OpenAPI calls, better for future caching and server-side features. App router offers modern routing and performance optimizations.  
**Alternatives Considered**: Create React App (simpler but no backend), Vite + Express (more setup), Remix (overkill for simple proxy).

### Decision: Tailwind CSS for styling framework

**Rationale**: Utility-first approach allows rapid dashboard development with consistent design, excellent for data-heavy interfaces like character cards and progress bars.  
**Alternatives Considered**: Material-UI (heavier, good for complex components), styled-components (more flexible but slower development), CSS modules (more boilerplate).

### Decision: Axios for API integration

**Rationale**: Robust HTTP client with interceptors for error handling, automatic JSON parsing, and timeout management suitable for OpenAPI calls.  
**Alternatives Considered**: Fetch API (native but requires more boilerplate), SuperAgent (less popular).

### Decision: Browser local storage for data persistence

**Rationale**: Meets client-side only constraint, allows caching character data for offline viewing, simple key-value storage.  
**Alternatives Considered**: IndexedDB (more complex for simple data), no storage (would require constant API calls).

### Decision: Jest with React Testing Library for testing

**Rationale**: Jest provides fast unit testing, React Testing Library focuses on user behavior testing aligning with TDD principles.  
**Alternatives Considered**: Vitest (faster but less mature), Cypress (e2e focused).

### Decision: Modern web browsers as target platform

**Rationale**: Broad compatibility, no additional tooling needed, aligns with client-side constraint.  
**Alternatives Considered**: Electron (desktop app but adds complexity), mobile web (limited by browser local storage).

## Integration Patterns

### Decision: Direct API integration with error handling

**Rationale**: Simple fetch from OpenAPI endpoints with try/catch for graceful degradation, matches spec requirements.  
**Alternatives Considered**: API gateway (unnecessary complexity), GraphQL client (overkill for simple REST API).

## Performance Considerations

### Decision: Lazy loading for character data

**Rationale**: Load character list first, then details on demand to meet 3-second load goal.  
**Alternatives Considered**: Preload all data (slower initial load), pagination (unnecessary for small datasets).

## Security Approach

### Decision: No authentication for initial version

**Rationale**: As clarified, no user data storage needed, API may not require auth, client-side only.  
**Alternatives Considered**: JWT tokens (adds complexity), OAuth (requires server).

## Observability

### Decision: Console logging with structured format

**Rationale**: Simple debug logging for API calls and errors, meets observability requirement without external services.  
**Alternatives Considered**: External logging service (requires server), no logging (violates constitution).
