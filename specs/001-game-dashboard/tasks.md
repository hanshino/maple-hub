# Tasks: Game Content Dashboard

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-game-dashboard/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per constitution Test-First principle - include them for all user stories.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Next.js app router**: `app/`, `components/`, `__tests__/`
- Adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create Next.js project with app router structure
- [x] T002 Install dependencies: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Axios, Jest, React Testing Library
- [x] T003 Configure Tailwind CSS in tailwind.config.js and globals.css
- [x] T004 Setup Jest testing environment with jest.config.js

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T005 Create API route for characters list at app/api/characters/route.js
- [x] T006 Create API route for character details at app/api/characters/[id]/route.js
- [x] T007 Create local storage utilities at lib/localStorage.js
- [x] T008 Create base layout at app/layout.js
- [x] T009 Create navigation component at components/Navigation.js

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - View Character Information (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Allow users to view basic character information on the dashboard

**Independent Test**: Load dashboard and verify character data displays correctly without other features

### Tests for User Story 1 ‚ö†Ô∏è

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [x] T010 [P] [US1] Unit test for CharacterCard component in **tests**/components/CharacterCard.test.js
- [x] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for dashboard page in **tests**/pages/dashboard.test.js

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T012 [P] [US1] Create CharacterCard component at components/CharacterCard.js
- [x] T013 [P] [US1] Create ProgressBar component at components/ProgressBar.js
- [x] T014 [US1] Create dashboard page at app/dashboard/page.js
- [x] T015 [US1] Integrate API calls in dashboard page
- [x] T016 [US1] Add character selection functionality

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Track Leveling Progress (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Show detailed leveling progress with statistics

**Independent Test**: View progress indicators and verify calculations work correctly

### Tests for User Story 2 ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [x] T017 [P] [US2] Unit test for ProgressBar detailed view in **tests**/components/ProgressBar.test.js
- [x] T018 [P] [US2] Integration test for progress tracking in **tests**/pages/dashboard-progress.test.js

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T019 [US2] Update ProgressBar for detailed progress display
- [x] T020 [US2] Add progress calculation utilities at lib/progressUtils.js
- [x] T021 [US2] Update dashboard to show detailed progress

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Handle API Integration Errors (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Gracefully handle API errors with user-friendly messages

**Independent Test**: Simulate API failures and verify error handling works

### Tests for User Story 3 ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [x] T022 [P] [US3] Test API error handling in **tests**/api/characters.test.js
- [x] T023 [P] [US3] Test error UI components in **tests**/components/ErrorMessage.test.js

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T024 [US3] Add error handling to API routes
- [x] T025 [US3] Create ErrorMessage component at components/ErrorMessage.js
- [x] T026 [US3] Update dashboard for error states
- [x] T027 [US3] Add retry functionality

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [x] T028 [P] Add responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- [x] T029 [P] Performance optimization and lazy loading
- [ ] T030 [P] Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] T031 Update documentation and README
- [ ] T032 Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses ProgressBar from US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses dashboard from US1 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Components before pages
- API integration after components
- Core implementation before error handling
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for CharacterCard component in __tests__/components/CharacterCard.test.js"
Task: "Integration test for dashboard page in __tests__/pages/dashboard.test.js"

# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create CharacterCard component at components/CharacterCard.js"
Task: "Create ProgressBar component at components/ProgressBar.js"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
