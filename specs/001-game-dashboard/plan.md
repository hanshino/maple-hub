# Implementation Plan: Game Content Dashboard

**Branch**: `001-game-dashboard` | **Date**: 2025-10-16 | **Spec**: specs/001-game-dashboard/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-game-dashboard/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create a client-side web dashboard that integrates with the game's OpenAPI to display character information, focusing on leveling progress with visual indicators, supporting multiple characters and graceful error handling.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES2020, Next.js 14  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, Axios for API integration  
**Storage**: Browser local storage for caching (initial), consider database later  
**Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers  
**Project Type**: Full-stack web application with Next.js  
**Performance Goals**: Dashboard loads character info within 3 seconds  
**Constraints**: Minimal backend services, primarily API proxy to official OpenAPI  
**Scale/Scope**: Single user with support for multiple characters, low data volume

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- [x] Library-First: Confirm feature starts as standalone library with clear purpose
- [x] CLI Interface: Ensure library exposes functionality via CLI with text I/O
- [x] Test-First: Verify TDD approach will be strictly enforced
- [x] Integration Testing: Plan for integration tests on contracts and inter-service communication
- [x] Observability: Include structured logging and debuggability measures
- [x] Versioning: Follow MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format for breaking changes
- [x] Simplicity: Start simple, apply YAGNI principles

**Structure Decision**: Next.js 14 app router structure with API routes for backend integration, components for UI, and standard testing setup. API routes will proxy calls to the official OpenAPI with minimal processing.
