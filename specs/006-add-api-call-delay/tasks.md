# Tasks: Add API Call Delay

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-add-api-call-delay/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per constitution Comprehensive Testing principle - include them for all user stories.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `lib/`, `__tests__/` at repository root
- Adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create lib/apiInterceptor.js file structure
- [x] T002 [P] Configure Jest test setup for interceptor in jest.config.js

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T003 Setup environment detection logic in lib/apiInterceptor.js
- [x] T004 [P] Implement delay utility function in lib/apiInterceptor.js

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Add API Call Delay in Development (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Add a 0.2 second delay to API calls in development environment to comply with the 5 requests/second rate limit for development keys, while production environment has no delay.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring API call timing in different environments - development calls should take at least 0.2 seconds longer, production calls should have no artificial delay.

### Tests for User Story 1 ‚ö†Ô∏è

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [x] T005 [P] [US1] Unit test for delay logic in **tests**/lib/apiInterceptor.test.js
- [x] T006 [P] [US1] Integration test for environment detection in **tests**/integration/apiThrottling.test.js

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T007 [US1] Implement Axios request interceptor with delay in lib/apiInterceptor.js
- [x] T008 [US1] Add cancellable delay logic for aborted requests
- [x] T009 [US1] Update existing API calls to use interceptor in lib/apiUtils.js

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [x] T010 [P] Documentation updates in README.md
- [x] T011 Code cleanup and refactoring in lib/apiInterceptor.js
- [x] T012 Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on User Story 1 being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to polish

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for delay logic in __tests__/lib/apiInterceptor.test.js"
Task: "Integration test for environment detection in __tests__/integration/apiThrottling.test.js"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add Polish ‚Üí Final validation

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently</content>
