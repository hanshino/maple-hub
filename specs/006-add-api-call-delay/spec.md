# Feature Specification: Add API Call Delay

**Feature Branch**: `006-add-api-call-delay`  
**Created**: 2025-10-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "我的專案已經上線了，我想要把前端呼叫 api 的時候都會等0.2秒的限制，只在 production 環境不受限制，但是開發階段還是需要等待0.2秒，因為開發階段會用開發時用的金鑰，只有線上環境才會有線上金鑰"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Add API Call Delay in Development (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want API calls in development environment to have a 0.2 second delay to comply with the 5 requests/second API rate limit for development keys, while production environment has no such delay to utilize the full 500 requests/second limit.

**Why this priority**: Protects development resources and API limits, ensures production performance is unaffected.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring API call timing in different environments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running in development environment, **When** an API call is made, **Then** there is a 0.2 second delay before the call executes
2. **Given** the application is running in production environment, **When** an API call is made, **Then** there is no artificial delay

### Edge Cases

- When multiple API calls are made simultaneously, each call is delayed individually by 0.2 seconds
- How does the system handle request cancellation during the delay? The delay is cancelled immediately if the request is aborted
- What if the environment detection fails?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST add a 0.2 second delay to all outgoing API calls when running in development environment
- **FR-002**: System MUST NOT add any delay to API calls when running in production environment
- **FR-003**: System MUST correctly detect whether it is running in development or production environment using the NODE_ENV environment variable
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure a minimum delay of 0.2 seconds per API call in development environment
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure API calls comply with rate limits (5 req/s in development, 500 req/s in production) through appropriate throttling

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **API Call**: Represents an outgoing HTTP request to external APIs, with attributes like URL, method, headers, and timing information

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: API calls in development environment take at least 0.2 seconds longer than network latency would suggest
- **SC-002**: API calls in production environment show no measurable artificial delay
- **SC-003**: No degradation in production environment performance metrics

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-18

- Q: How does the 0.2 second delay relate to the provided API rate limits? → A: The 0.2s delay ensures compliance with the 5 req/s development limit
