## Findings

### Decision: Use Axios Request Interceptor for Delay Implementation

**Rationale**: Axios interceptors provide a clean, centralized way to modify outgoing requests in a Next.js/React application. They allow conditional logic based on environment without scattering delay code throughout the application.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Custom API wrapper function: Would require wrapping all API calls, more invasive
- Browser-level throttling: Too broad, affects all network requests
- Service worker: Overkill for simple delay requirement

### Decision: Environment Detection via NODE_ENV

**Rationale**: Standard Next.js environment variable, reliable and already configured in the project.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Custom environment variable: Unnecessary complexity
- Runtime detection: Less reliable than build-time configuration

### Decision: Minimum 0.2s Delay with Cancellable Requests

**Rationale**: Ensures compliance with 5 req/s limit while allowing immediate cancellation to prevent wasted time on aborted requests.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Fixed 0.2s delay: Could waste time on cancelled requests
- No cancellation: Poor user experience for aborted requests
