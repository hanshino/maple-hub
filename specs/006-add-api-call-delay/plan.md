# Implementation Plan: Add API Call Delay

**Branch**: `006-add-api-call-delay` | **Date**: 2025-10-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-add-api-call-delay/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Add a 0.2 second delay to all API calls in development environment to comply with the 5 requests/second rate limit for development API keys, while ensuring no delay in production to utilize the full 500 requests/second limit. Technical approach: Implement delay using Axios request interceptors with environment-based conditional logic.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES2020, Next.js 14, React 18  
**Primary Dependencies**: Axios for API calls, NODE_ENV for environment detection  
**Storage**: N/A (client-side only)  
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Web browser  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend)  
**Performance Goals**: API calls in development take at least 0.2 seconds longer  
**Constraints**: Comply with API rate limits (5 req/s in development, 500 req/s in production)  
**Scale/Scope**: Frontend API throttling for single application

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- [x] User-Centric Design: Feature does not impact production user experience
- [x] API Integration Excellence: Ensures robust external API handling with rate limit compliance
- [x] Component Reusability: N/A - no new components required
- [x] Comprehensive Testing: Include unit tests for delay logic and environment detection
- [x] Data Visualization: N/A - no data visualization involved
- [x] Performance & Optimization: Includes performance optimization (no delay in production)
- [x] Simplicity & Maintainability: Simple conditional delay logic following clean code principles

## Structure Decision

**Structure Decision**: Frontend-only modification to existing Next.js application. New interceptor added to lib/ directory, tests added to **tests**/ following existing project structure.
