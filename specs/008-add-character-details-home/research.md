# Research Findings: Add Character Details to Home Page

**Date**: 2025-10-19  
**Feature**: 008-add-character-details-home

## Research Tasks Completed

### Character Stats Display Format

**Decision**: Table format with paired rows (屬性: 數值 屬性: 數值 per row)  
**Rationale**: Provides clear, organized display of multiple stats while maintaining readability. Paired rows optimize horizontal space usage.  
**Alternatives Considered**:

- Single column list (too vertical, wastes horizontal space)
- Grid layout (less organized for key-value pairs)
- Card-based layout (better for single values, not optimal for paired display)

### Min/Max Stat Range Merging

**Decision**: Merge min/max pairs (e.g., 最低屬性攻擊力/最高屬性攻擊力) into single range display  
**Rationale**: Reduces visual clutter and provides more meaningful information by showing the range rather than separate values.  
**Alternatives Considered**:

- Display separately (creates visual noise)
- Show only max value (loses range information)
- Use expandable details (adds complexity)

### Equipment Grid Layout Optimization

**Decision**: Fixed 100x100px slots with centered content and consistent spacing  
**Rationale**: Ensures visual consistency across all equipment items regardless of content length. 100px provides adequate space for icons and text while maintaining responsive design.  
**Alternatives Considered**:

- Auto-sizing based on content (creates inconsistent layout)
- Smaller slots (50x50px - too cramped for text)
- Larger slots (150x150px - wastes space on mobile)

### API Data Processing Strategy

**Decision**: Process equipment data on client-side with preset merging logic  
**Rationale**: Allows flexible data transformation without server-side changes. Preset merging ensures correct equipment display based on user selection.  
**Alternatives Considered**:

- Server-side processing (adds unnecessary API complexity)
- Raw data display (requires client-side processing anyway)

### Caching Strategy Validation

**Decision**: 5-minute client-side caching with error handling (localStorage optional)  
**Rationale**: Balances data freshness with API rate limits. Client-side storage provides simple, reliable caching when available.  
**Alternatives Considered**:

- Session storage (data lost on tab close)
- No caching (increases API load)
- Longer cache duration (data becomes stale)

## Technical Dependencies Confirmed

- **Material-UI Grid**: Suitable for responsive equipment layout
- **Next.js Image**: Handles equipment icon loading with error states
- **Client-side Storage API**: Optional localStorage for caching when available
- **Axios**: Handles API calls with interceptors for error management

## Performance Considerations

- Image lazy loading for equipment icons
- Memoized data processing to prevent unnecessary re-computations
- Efficient state management to minimize re-renders
- Responsive design ensures good performance across devices

## Accessibility Notes

- Keyboard navigation support for equipment dialog
- Screen reader friendly labels for all interactive elements
- High contrast colors for stat displays
- Semantic HTML structure for equipment grid</content>
