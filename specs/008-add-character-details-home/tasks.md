# Tasks: Add Character Details to Home Page

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-add-character-details-home/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per constitution Comprehensive Testing principle - include them for all user stories.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Web app: `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `__tests__/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Configure environment variables for Nexon API in .env.local
- [x] T002 Verify Material-UI dependencies are installed
- [x] T003 [P] Create feature-specific directories in specs/008-add-character-details-home/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T004 Create Nexon API utility functions in lib/nexonApi.js
- [x] T005 [P] Implement caching utility for API responses in lib/cache.js
- [x] T006 [P] Create equipment data processing utility in lib/equipmentUtils.js
- [x] T007 [P] Create stats data processing utility in lib/statsUtils.js
- [x] T008 Setup error handling utilities for API calls in lib/apiErrorHandler.js

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - View Character Equipment on Home Page (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Display character equipment in a dialog with grid layout

**Independent Test**: Click equipment button on home page, verify dialog opens with equipment grid and character image

### Tests for User Story 1 ‚ö†Ô∏è

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [x] T009 [P] [US1] Unit test for equipment data processing in **tests**/lib/equipmentUtils.test.js
- [x] T010 [P] [US1] Integration test for equipment dialog in **tests**/components/EquipmentDialog.test.js

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T011 [US1] Create EquipmentDialog component in components/EquipmentDialog.js
- [x] T012 [US1] Implement equipment grid layout with character image in components/EquipmentDialog.js
- [x] T013 [US1] Create equipment API route in app/api/character/equipment/route.js
- [x] T014 [US1] Add equipment button to home page in app/page.js
- [x] T015 [US1] Integrate equipment dialog with home page button in app/page.js

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - View Character Stats on Home Page (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Display character stats in card format on home page

**Independent Test**: Load home page, verify stats block displays with battle power in character card

### Tests for User Story 2 ‚ö†Ô∏è

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [x] T016 [P] [US2] Unit test for stats data processing in **tests**/lib/statsUtils.test.js
- [x] T017 [P] [US2] Integration test for stats display in **tests**/components/CharacterStats.test.js

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T018 [US2] Create CharacterStats component in components/CharacterStats.js
- [x] T019 [US2] Implement stats card grid layout in components/CharacterStats.js
- [x] T020 [US2] Create stats API route in app/api/character/stats/route.js
- [x] T021 [US2] Add stats block to home page in app/page.js
- [x] T022 [US2] Integrate battle power display in existing CharacterCard component in components/CharacterCard.js

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [x] T023 [P] Add accessibility features to equipment dialog in components/EquipmentDialog.js
- [x] T024 [P] Add accessibility features to stats display in components/CharacterStats.js
- [x] T025 Performance optimization for API caching in lib/cache.js
- [x] T026 [P] Update documentation in README.md
- [x] T027 Run quickstart.md validation and update if needed

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- API routes before components
- Components before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, both user stories can start in parallel
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for equipment data processing in __tests__/lib/equipmentUtils.test.js"
Task: "Integration test for equipment dialog in __tests__/components/EquipmentDialog.test.js"

# Launch implementation tasks sequentially:
Task: "Create EquipmentDialog component in components/EquipmentDialog.js"
Task: "Implement equipment grid layout with character image in components/EquipmentDialog.js"
Task: "Create equipment API route in app/api/character/equipment/route.js"
Task: "Add equipment button to home page in app/page.js"
Task: "Integrate equipment dialog with home page button in app/page.js"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence</content>
