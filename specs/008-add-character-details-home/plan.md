# Implementation Plan: Add Character Details to Home Page

**Branch**: `008-add-character-details-home` | **Date**: 2025-10-19 | **Spec**: specs/008-add-character-details-home/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/008-add-character-details-home/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Add character equipment dialog and stats display to home page. Equipment shown in grid layout dialog, stats displayed in table format with paired rows and merged min/max ranges.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES2020  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14, React 18, Material-UI, Axios  
**Storage**: Client-side caching (optional localStorage implementation)  
**Testing**: Jest for unit tests, integration tests for API routes  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (responsive design)  
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js frontend)  
**Performance Goals**: Page load within 2 seconds, 95% success rate  
**Constraints**: Cache data for 5 minutes, handle API failures gracefully  
**Scale/Scope**: Single character display, moderate data volume

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- [x] User-Centric Design: Feature prioritizes user experience with intuitive equipment dialog and clear stats display
- [x] API Integration Excellence: Robust external API handling with error management and 5-minute caching
- [x] Component Reusability: Modular React components (EquipmentDialog, CharacterStats) with consistent Material-UI styling
- [x] Comprehensive Testing: Unit tests for components, integration tests for API routes, accessibility testing
- [x] Data Visualization: Clear table format for stats, grid layout for equipment visualization
- [x] Performance & Optimization: 5-minute caching, efficient state management, fast loading times
- [x] Simplicity & Maintainability: Clean ES2020 code, consistent project structure, clear component separation

_Post-Phase 1 Re-check: All principles satisfied with detailed design specifications._
